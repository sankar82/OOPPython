**Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Curriculum**

Welcome to this comprehensive curriculum on Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This course was carefully designed to introduce learners to the foundational and advanced concepts of OOP in Python. By traversing this curriculum, you can expect to transition from a beginner to a confident user of Python's OOP features.

**Course Objectives**

The primary objective of this course is to provide a **clear, step-by-step, learner-centric approach to Python's OOP paradigm.** The curriculum focuses on explaining complex concepts in a **simple, easy-to-understand manner, with an emphasis on hands-on learning.** It breaks down technical details to a level that can be understood by high school students and adults alike.

**What You Will Learn**

By going through this curriculum, you will:

* Understand the fundamental principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
* Learn how to define classes and create objects in Python.
* Understand and implement properties like methods, instance variables, and class variables.
* Learn about special methods and how they allow Python classes to emulate built-in types.
* Understand the concept of inheritance and how to create subclasses in Python.
* Learn about method overriding and its importance in customizing class behavior.
* Understand the concept of abstract base classes and how they can enforce certain methods in subclasses.
* The curriculum also includes a practical example the end, where you will get a chance to see how this in applied in real-world programming scenarios. I use the example of Pytorch. 

**Who This Course Is For?**

This curriculum is perfect for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Python and its OOP principles. It is ideal for beginners who have a basic understanding of Python and want to take their skills to the next level, as well as for experienced programmers who want to solidify their understanding of OOP in Python.

**How to Use This Repository?**

There are two notebooks in this repository. You can start with either one. In the notebook **"OOPS_Concepts_Learning.ipynb"** I gathered notes from multiple sources and also used ChatGPT primarily to structure this curriculum. In the second notebook, **"OOPS_Real_Python.ipynb"** I compiled notes from Real Python, and I have credited the original source in the notebook, in case you would like to take a look at it. 

In either notebook, you could start by reading through the concepts in order, as each one builds upon the concepts of the previous one. Please don't rush through the content; do take your time to understand each concept thoroughly, and don't hesitate to revisit any topic that feels challenging.

I hope this course aids you in your journey as a Python programmer, and we can't wait to see what you build with your newfound skills. Happy learning!

Please feel free to give your feedback on how this can be improved or if you catch any errors! Thanks for reading.
