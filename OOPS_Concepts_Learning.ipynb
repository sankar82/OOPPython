        "## **What is OOPS?**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, which is a **way of organizing and designing computer programs** so that **properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.** \n",
        "\n",
        "OOPS is based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of \"classes.\" \n",
        "\n",
        "**A \"class\" is essentially a blueprint or a template for creating objects.** It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. For example, a class called \"Car\" might define properties such as \"make\", \"model\", and \"year\", as well as behaviors such as \"start engine\", \"accelerate\", and \"brake\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**An \"object\" is an instance of a class.** It is created using the blueprint provided by the class, and has its own unique set of values for the properties defined by the class. For example, an object of the \"Car\" class might have the make \"Toyota\", the model \"Camry\", and the year \"2018\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In simpler terms, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is like a specific instance of that blueprint. Just like how a blueprint can be used to create many buildings that share the same design, a class can be used to create many objects that share the same properties and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 4 key principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Encapsulation**\n",
        "**2. Inheritance**\n",
        "**3. Polymorphism**\n",
        "**4. Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the technique of **hiding the internal workings of an object and providing access to the object's properties and methods through a public interface.** It means that the user only needs to know how to use the object's methods and properties, without knowing how they work under the hood. It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This also makes the concept of data hiding possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** Inheritance is the **process of creating a new class based on an existing class, where the new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.** The existing class is called the **parent class or super class**, and the new class is called the **child class or sub class.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:**   Polymorphism is the ability of **objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class.** This is due to inheritance and this is possible because they share a common interface (*Refer to make_sound() method in the Polymorphism section*), which allows them to be used interchangeably in certain situations. This means that we can have different objects with different behaviors but with a common interface. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the user. It means that we only expose the essential features of an object and hide the rest of the details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of OOP in Python like creating a blueprint for a house. The blueprint itself is like a class in Python. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on this blueprint, you can build a house. The house is like an object, an instance of the class."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's go through each of these concepts and explain them with simple examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say we have a class called Car that has properties like make, model, and year. We can encapsulate these properties by making them private and providing public methods like getMake(), getModel(), and getYear() to access them. This way, the user can only interact with the object through these public methods, and they don't need to know how the properties are stored or manipulated within the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is about hiding the internal states and functionality of objects, and exposing only what's necessary. It's like the inner workings of a car – you don't need to know how the engine works in order to drive the car. You only need to know how to interact with the car's controls like the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons. In programming terms, this is accomplished by making the data fields private and providing public methods (getters and setters) for accessing and modifying them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say we have a class called Animal with properties like name and age, and methods like eat() and sleep(). We can create a child class called Cat that inherits from Animal and adds its own properties and methods. The Cat class would have access to all the properties and methods of Animal, and we can add new properties and methods specific to cats, like color and meow().\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Polymorphism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say we have a class called Shape with a method called area(). We can create different child classes like Circle and Rectangle that inherit from Shape and override the area() method to calculate the area of the circle or rectangle. Now, we can create an array of Shape objects and add both circles and rectangles to it. When we call the area() method on each object, the appropriate method for each object will be called based on its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say we have a class called BankAccount with properties like balance and methods like deposit() and withdraw(). We can abstract away the implementation details of the class and provide a simple interface to the user with methodslike getBalance() and makeTransaction(), which shows only the necessary information to the user and hides the complex implementation details of how the transactions are processed and how the balance is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, abstraction is a broader concept. It involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts, and providing simple interfaces for interacting with the system. It's like the dashboard of the car – it abstracts away the complexity of the car's systems and provides you with a simple interface (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) for understanding what's happening."

        "From what I learned in Real Python about OOP, in the `__init__(self)` line we also give other parameters. We don't do it here. Not sure why we are not saying init(self,name,age). ***You can find this example in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TAPVm4w5LfrDLr_d14wQeQp6B-jmntlJ)***\n",

        "n Python, the init method is used to initialize the attributes of an object. The variables conv1 and conv2 are not included as parameters in the init method because they are attributes of the Model object that are being defined within the init method itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The parameters that you include inside the parentheses of the init method are values that you need to provide when you create an object.** These are typically variables that could change from one object to another. For example, if you were creating a Dog class, you might include name and age as parameters in your init method, because these are things that vary from one dog to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in your Model class, conv1 and conv2 are being set to specific convolutional layers every time a Model object is created. These aren't things that you'd want to change from one model to another, so they're not included as parameters. Instead, they're set as attributes within the init method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Here's an analogy:** imagine you're building a car. Some parts of the car, like the color or the type of seats, might be customizable -- these are like the parameters in your init method. But other parts, like the engine or the wheels, are going to be the same in every car you build. You still need to put them in each car you build, and that's what's happening with conv1 and conv2 in the init method.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in simple terms: **self is always the first parameter for any class method in Python (including init).** The other parameters to init are typically variables that could change from one instance of the class to another. In this case, conv1 and conv2 are not parameters because they are set to specific values every time an instance of Model is created."
